# Airbnb-pricing-prediction-an-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project


In the landscape of modern travel, Airbnb stands as a beacon of innovation,
redefining the hospitality sector by offering unique accommodation experiences
worldwide. Understanding the dynamic interplay of factors that contribute to
Airbnb pricing is necessary in navigating this evolving market. Analyzing
these factors not only sheds light on the essence of what shapes the cost of a
stay but also holds the key to unlocking strategic insights for hosts and
helps guests to make informed decisions. As the travel industry continues to
transform, dissecting these elements becomes an essential compass for both
hosts seeking to optimize revenue and guests aiming to find the perfect blend
of value and experience in their accommodations.


**Dataset:**
The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from the research study,
"Determinants of Airbnb prices in European cities: A spatial econometrics
approach"
[1] and is hosted on Kaggle
[2]. The data was collected through a
systematic web-scraping experiment. The experiment targeted Airbnb listings in
ten major European cities. Prices were collected four to six weeks ahead of
the travel dates, encompassing the total accommodation cost, including
reservation and cleaning fees. Each city yielded two datasets: one capturing
weekday offers (Tuesday to Thursday) and another capturing weekend offers
(Friday to Sunday). For the purpose of this project, data from only one of the
ten cities (London) has been analyzed.
